1. SYNOPSIS

SimLife is a program for simulating cellular automata and similar, e.g. Life.
You can add your own sets of rules which can have their own sets of
parameters - see life.spr for an example.


SimLife works with X and Win32.

On-line help is provided - start up the program and click the Help menu option
or press F1. (Reading what's there will help!)


2. REQUIREMENTS

Optional modules (from CPAN):
(none)

Linux and X-Windows:
Perl 5.004
Tk 400.202

Win32:
Perl 5.005
Tk 800.000

~80K disk space.


3. INSTALLATION

Note that SimLife can be installed pretty well anywhere - the only restriction
is that all the simlife* files must be together in the same directory.

# Create the directory.
mkdir /usr/opt/simlife

# Copy the tar.gz to the lib directory.
cp simlife-VERSION.tar.gz /usr/opt

# Change to the opt directory.
cd /usr/opt

# Unpack the archive using method A or B:
# Method A for those using GNU tar
tar xvfz simlife-VERSION.tar.gz
# Method B for those not using GNU tar
gunzip simlife-VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf simlife-VERSION.tar

# Change to the simlife directory.
cd simlife

# This is optional. Make sure SimLife is executable.
chmod +x simlife

# If this is an upgrade from a previous version and you're not using Win32
# then keep your options.
mv ~/.simlife-opts ~/.simliferc

# This is optional. For Debian users only: if you want SimLife to appear on
# your X menu do the following:
cp debian-menu /etc/menu/simlife
update-menus
# Note that the name of the file supplied, 'debian-menu', is changed in the
# move to 'simlife'. Note also that if you haven't used the paths given here you
# must change the command path in /etc/menu/simlife. The addition to the menu
# will only appear when the window manager is restarted.

# This is optional. To have the icon appear under X for icewm do this:
cd /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/icewm/icons/
ln -s /usr/opt/simlife/simlife-icon-16x16.xpm simlife_16x16.xpm
ln -s /usr/opt/simlife/simlife-icon-16x16.xpm simlife_32x32.xpm
# and add the following line to /etc/X11/icewm/winoptions
simlife.icon: simlife

# To run SimLife from the command line:
/usr/opt/simlife/simlife &

# You could always either alias this or use a soft link to a directory on the
# path to save typing the whole path. Note that 'deprecated' error messages
# which appear are harmless and can be ignored.
